1. **Population with a Single Sample (23andme, LivingDNA, MyHeritage...so on)**:
   - This refers to a scenario where you have genetic data from only one individual representing a particular population. This could be due to various reasons such as limited sampling, difficulty in obtaining genetic material, or the uniqueness of the individual within its population.

2. **F2 Statistics**:
   - F2 statistics are a type of genetic statistic used to measure genetic distances and relationships between populations. They are crucial in determining the level of genetic admixture or ancestry between populations.

3. **Impact of Single Sample on F2 Statistics**:
   - When you have a population represented by a single sample, certain F2 statistics cannot be accurately computed. This is because F2 statistics typically require genetic information from multiple individuals within each population to calculate reliable estimates.
   - In cases where F2 statistics cannot be evaluated due to the single-sample population, these statistics are reported with a very large variance, often set to 100. This high variance indicates uncertainty in the estimate and signifies that the value is not reliable for making robust conclusions about genetic relationships or admixture.

4. **Effect on qpGraph**:
   - `qpGraph` is a tool used to construct and analyze admixture graphs based on genetic data, specifically using F2 statistics among other parameters.
   - When F2 statistics are undetermined or have high variance due to single-sample populations, the edges (connections) in the admixture graph that rely on these statistics may be set to 0.
   - Setting an edge to 0 in qpGraph indicates that the genetic relationship or admixture between populations represented by that edge is uncertain or undetermined due to the lack of reliable F2 statistics.

In summary, having a population with a single sample affects the ability to compute certain F2 statistics accurately. These statistics are crucial inputs for tools like `qpGraph`, and when they cannot be reliably calculated, the corresponding edges in the admixture graph are considered undetermined (set to 0). This highlights the importance of having sufficient and representative genetic data for each population to obtain meaningful insights into their genetic relationships and admixture history.
